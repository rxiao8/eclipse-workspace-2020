/*Rose 
 * October 2020
 * Write a program that plays tic-tac-toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid (think 2D array). The
game is played by two players, the ‘X’ player and the ‘O’ player. The player who goes first is the
‘O’ player. The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical or diagonal sequence of three
marks wins. Your program should declare a winner. You may handle the moves and display
however you wish.
You need to have at least two classes. A game class and the driver class.
The game class needs to handle the board. You are welcome to add a third
class of the player, but it is not necessary.*/
